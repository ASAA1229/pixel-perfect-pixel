# Delivery plan and release gates (2026-10-31)

Status: the roadmap below is the execution order. A checkbox is not considered complete until there is evidence from a successful build/test run or documented manual acceptance. Do not merge to main or publish/deploy without explicit approval.

## P0 — unblock engineering and establish reliable validation

1. **EPIC-01 — Build stability and engineering foundation**
   - [x] Align the package manifest with the existing lockfile: `@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config` is now `2.25.3` in both files (commit `4fd8402`).
   - [ ] If the intended dependency target is still `2.26.5`, regenerate the lockfile with Node.js 24/npm in a network-enabled environment; do not hand-edit lockfile integrity/resolution metadata.
   - [ ] Run and record `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test` successfully. These have not yet been run against the aligned commit.
   - [x] Verification workflow configuration is limited to pushes to `dev`, pull requests targeting `dev`/`main`, or manual dispatch, with cancellation of stale runs; a successful run is still needed.
2. **EPIC-02 — Portfolio-wide functional validation**
   - [ ] Build a route/interaction acceptance matrix for all four profiles and record browser-level results.
   - [ ] Cover desktop, tablet and mobile, including loading, empty, offline, validation and failure states.
   - [ ] Verify navigation, chat/voice, contact, resume workflows and profile-data isolation.
   - [x] Add data-level acceptance tests for project/slug consistency, navigation data, contact destinations, experience, skills and certifications (commit `c7c407c`); run them and add browser smoke checks based on the matrix.

## Development-only execution (user direction, 2026-10-31)

Testing and validation work is paused by user request. Continue feature implementation on the current feature branch; do not run tests, build, lint, browser checks, or acceptance exercises until the user resumes that work.

## P1 — product capabilities

3. **EPIC-07 — Resume Manager and document processing**
   - [x] Add client-side search across filename, display name, headline, summary and skills.
   - [x] Add status filtering (all, pending review, approved/published), clear-filters action, result count and published/pending summary counts (commit `f1ed72e`).
   - [x] Save reviewed metadata as a private pending draft without publishing; moving an approved record back to draft removes it from the public approved-resume feed.
   - [x] Add bounded best-effort PDF/DOCX text extraction into private review notes with a manual edit step; scanned PDFs/OCR and complex PDF font encodings remain unsupported (commit `0f5a5bb`).
   - [x] Add explicit profile assignment (Abhishek, Amulya, Anjini Kumar or Sai); publishing rejects missing/invalid assignment and excludes unassigned or legacy records from the public feed.
   - [x] Render approved resume metadata only on its matching public profile homepage, with no source-file links and no changes to the existing hardcoded portfolio facts (commit `5373a93`).
   - [ ] Authentication/session, storage, upload/download/delete and file-boundary validation are deferred while testing is paused.
   - [x] Add strict validation for persisted private resume-index records, including UUIDs, allowed content types, size bounds, profile IDs, structured-section shapes and duplicate IDs; corrupted indexes fail closed rather than being silently treated as empty (source change only, commit `b5b3006`).
   - [x] Make resume upload storage/index updates clean up the newly stored private file if index persistence fails, preventing orphaned uploads where cleanup succeeds (source change only, commit `b5b3006`).
   - [x] Restrict resume record API paths to canonical UUIDs before resolving private storage keys (source change only, commit `b5b3006`).
   - [ ] Verify these storage and boundary behaviors with failure-injection tests and hosted storage checks when validation resumes.
4. **EPIC-08 — Dynamic profile updates and publishing**
   - [x] Centralize approved-resume feed serialization and order unpublish/draft/delete operations to remove public visibility before persisting private status/removal; publishing persists private approval before exposing the public feed. Object storage remains non-transactional, so partial failures require reconciliation and runtime failure-injection verification (commits `c0127e6`, `fb3f084`).
   - [x] Add a public metadata-only resume highlights section filtered by profile ID; private resume files remain inaccessible from public profile pages (commit `5373a93`).
   - [x] Add an in-manager public-field preview, explicit unpublish/rollback to private pending status, and require profile assignment before publishing (commits `34c10a1`, `9298ca8`, `77b4f54`).
   - [x] Add a final publish confirmation and client-side checks for profile assignment, display name, headline, summary and empty skill entries (commit `4fad5ea`).
   - [x] Make desktop and mobile cinematic-series controls navigate to the relevant projects page instead of presenting a non-functional “coming soon” action (commit `d9404cb`).
   - [x] Expose the current page through `aria-current="page"` on desktop and mobile primary-navigation links (commit `ad25264`).
- [x] Validate resume upload filename extensions and PDF/ZIP signatures before private storage to reject mismatched or obviously invalid uploads (commit `7580f5e`).
- [x] Add client-side resume upload preflight for supported extensions, declared MIME type and 10 MB limit, plus selected-file details and a clear-selection action (commit `9f7d8d4`).
- [x] Update Amulya (Amu) profile gallery media: replace `amulya_1.webp` with `ammu3.jpeg` and `amulya_2.webp` with `amulya_main.webp` (commit `5303355`).
- [x] Add private source-text notes to the Resume Manager review workflow; notes can be pasted manually, saved only in the private index, capped at 12,000 characters, and excluded from the public feed (commits `c5862c9`, `7519102`).
   - [ ] Verify preview, approval, publish, rollback and local/hosted behavior when validation resumes.
5. **EPIC-06 — AI assistant, chat and voice**
   - [ ] Verify API configuration, grounded profile-specific answers, streaming/cancellation and honest offline fallback.
   - [ ] Test microphone permissions, unsupported browsers, privacy disclosures and failure recovery.
6. **EPIC-05 — Four profile experiences and content architecture**
   - [ ] Verify typed profile data, shared page components, route compatibility and strict separation of facts across Abhishek, Amulya, Anjini and Sai.
7. **EPIC-04 — Cinematic design and media**
   - [ ] Verify all supplied media assets exist and are correctly licensed/attributed where required.
   - [ ] Complete video intro playback, pause/replay, cleanup, reduced-motion behavior and mobile fallback.
8. **EPIC-03 — Shared UI, navigation and responsive experience**
   - [ ] Validate shared navigation/footer, active states, keyboard operation, responsive layouts and all route links.
9. **EPIC-09 — Security, accessibility and performance**
   - [ ] Audit access control, upload validation, public/private data boundaries, keyboard/screen-reader behavior and performance.
   - [x] Stop using caller-supplied `X-Forwarded-For` as the login rate-limit identity; use only the platform-provided `CF-Connecting-IP` value and fall back to a shared `unknown` bucket when unavailable (commit `45e3134`). Source-only security hardening; proxy behavior and distributed rate-limit coverage remain unverified.
   - [x] Respect the operating system reduced-motion preference by disabling the autoplaying intro video and decorative particle animation when reduced motion is requested (commits `eb6c337`, `17a47b5`). Source-only accessibility improvement; browser and assistive-technology behavior remains unverified.
   - [x] Make the floating portfolio chat an explicitly modal dialog for assistive technology and keep keyboard Tab/Shift+Tab navigation inside it; Escape closes it and returns focus to the launcher (commit `cbb84e9`). Source-only improvement; screen-reader and browser behavior remain unverified.
   - [x] Improve responsive navigation keyboard behavior: opening the mobile menu moves focus to its first item, and Escape closes it and restores focus to the menu toggle (commit `f4e7414`). Source-only improvement; browser and assistive-technology behavior remains unverified.
   - [x] Enforce the chat API's 70 KB request limit while reading the body, not only from the optional `Content-Length` header, so chunked requests cannot bypass the transport bound (commit `84adc97`). Source-only security hardening; runtime behavior remains unverified.
   - [x] Strictly validate admin session cookies before HMAC verification: enforce the timestamp/signature format, exact 32-byte SHA-256 signature length and canonical base64url encoding (commits `42b63cd`, `973726e`). Source-only security hardening; runtime behavior remains unverified.
10. **EPIC-10 — End-to-end acceptance and release**
    - [ ] Run the full acceptance matrix on the candidate branch and record results.
    - [ ] Review the complete branch diff and outstanding issues.
    - [ ] Obtain explicit user approval before any merge to `main` or deployment.

## Working rules
- During the user-requested development-only phase, continue feature implementation and explicitly leave validation tasks pending.
- Do not mark validation complete based only on source inspection; record the command/test or manual evidence when testing resumes.
- Do not commit generated lockfile metadata by hand.
- Do not merge to `main`, publish, or deploy without explicit approval.


## Upload-driven profile content automation

- [x] Let resume uploads select their target profile at upload time; persist that assignment in the private record so users do not have to assign it again afterward (commits `57956e1`, `fc1d9c0`).
- [x] Keep image uploads associated with a selected profile and serve approved images through the dynamic profile gallery feed.
- [x] Add an explicit publish-immediately option to the image upload form; server publishes the stored image and marks it approved in the same upload workflow (commits `b75f9d5`, `8638d47`).
- [ ] Add reliable PDF/DOCX text extraction to prefill editable resume fields and profile content from the uploaded document. Current runtime dependencies do not include a document parser; choose and integrate an appropriate parser before claiming extraction is automated.
- [x] Add conservative heading-based mapping for experience, education, skills, projects and certifications into private review notes; suggest skills in the editable review form. This does not yet populate the structured public profile sections, and explicit approval remains required (commits `f281381`, `230ff68`, `2bc68a8`).
- [x] Add editable structured experience, education, project and certification fields to the private review record; heading mapping can prefill them, drafts persist privately, and only explicitly approved structured fields enter the metadata-only public resume feed (commits `af32b89`, `64a3693`). Existing hardcoded profile facts are not overwritten; public profile rendering of these new fields remains a separate follow-up.
- [x] Render explicitly published experience, education, project and certification additions on their matching public profile sections, filtered by profile ID; existing static portfolio content remains intact (commit `2ad8870`).
- [x] Split recognized resume sections into separate editable review entries at blank-line and explicit bullet boundaries; wrapped lines remain together and mapping remains conservative (commits `afbd013`, `eaf833e`).
- [x] Add per-entry editing controls for structured resume sections, including add/remove actions, visible entry counts, and bounded per-entry character and count limits; changes remain private until explicit publication (commit `fefb6ec`).
- [ ] Define whether image uploads should support an explicit publish-on-upload option; current behavior intentionally keeps uploads private/pending until publication.
- [ ] Validate upload-to-profile mapping, extraction quality, draft editing, publication and rollback when testing resumes.

## Image asset reliability and dynamic media (development work)

- [x] Correct Amulya gallery references that pointed to `ammu3.jpeg`, which is not present in `public/images/profiles/amulya/` on this branch; keep references on committed assets until the new upload is available (commit `d6f2dfd`).
- [x] Add a repeatable `npm run audit:images` source/public asset audit script. It reports missing image paths, likely filename case mismatches, and unreferenced public images; it has not been run while validation is paused.
- [x] Add authenticated image upload/review/publish workflow using the existing object bucket; images remain pending/private until approval and public metadata exposes only approved image IDs, profile IDs, alt text, and app-served URLs (commits `4b7ed77`, `6a32d2d`).
- [ ] Reconcile any newly uploaded public-directory changes with this branch and run `npm run audit:images` to repair every missing/case-mismatched reference; execution is paused.
- [x] Add an explicit `/people/$person/education` route to make the Education destination a first-class route alongside the shared `$section` route (commit `1defd54`).
- [ ] After validation resumes, regenerate/inspect the TanStack route tree and directly open `/education` plus `/people/ammu/education`, `/people/bava/education`, and `/people/sai/education`; the 404 fix is implemented but not yet acceptance-verified.

- [x] Fix a source-inspection issue in JPEG filename validation: the escaped dot now matches `.jpg` and `.jpeg` filenames as intended (commit `7d7f87c`). This is a code change only; upload behavior remains untested while validation is paused.
- [x] Add image unpublish/rollback so an approved image can be removed from public galleries without deleting the private original (commits `d7ea286`, `23ae216`). Source changes only; behavior is not runtime-verified while testing is paused.
- [x] Validate persisted image-index records and duplicate IDs before use; roll back incomplete private/public upload objects when the index write fails; remove public image bytes and index visibility before deleting the private original (commit `5b547ac`). Source-only change; failure-injection and hosted object-storage behavior remain unverified while testing is paused.


## Shared profile design and image refresh

- [x] Extract the shared cinematic profile layout rules into `src/styles/profiles.css`; all four profile routes consume the same imported stylesheet and design tokens (commits `6bdf67d`, `9490d8e`).
- [ ] Replace legacy static profile image assets and every source reference with the files from the newly supplied `images.zip`. The archive includes HEIC photos, which need conversion to browser-friendly formats before references can safely be switched. Do not delete the currently referenced assets until the replacement binaries have been added to the branch; otherwise profile images would break. Testing remains paused.

## Source-level bug review (testing remains paused)

- [x] Fixed the admin image publish/unpublish route matcher so it matches the actual `/api/admin/images/:id/(publish|unpublish)` paths.
- [x] Fixed resume draft saving so edited private review notes are sent to and persisted by the existing draft API.
- [x] Fixed streamed AI-provider error messages to use actual line breaks rather than displaying literal escaped newline characters.
- [x] Updated the image-manager submit label to distinguish private uploads from immediate publication.
- [x] Hardened admin path canonicalization by decoding bounded nested URL-encoding layers and rejecting malformed or still-encoded paths before routing (commits `8e5f724`, `54b85f9`, `999b02b`). Source-only change; route behavior remains unverified while testing is paused.
- [ ] Continue source-only review of imports/exports, route wiring, request/response contracts, state handling, accessibility, and security. Do not run tests, builds, lint, browser checks, or audits until testing is explicitly resumed.
- [x] Corrected resume section entry parsing to use actual newline normalization, splitting, list-marker matching and entry joining (commit `7fd49d6`). Source-only correction; behavior remains unverified while testing is paused.
- [x] Fix resume section parsing so CR/LF normalization, line splitting, list-marker detection and editable-entry joining use actual newline/whitespace characters rather than literal backslash sequences (commit `b4b3cd5`). Source inspection only; behavior remains unverified while testing is paused.
