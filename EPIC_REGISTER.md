Historical roadmap states testing was paused during a development-only period. Do not silently treat source changes as tested or accepted.

**Reconciled 2026-11-14 (documentation owner):** development, testing, integration and acceptance columns updated to the verified evidence in PROJECT_STATUS.md. Local evidence is not CI evidence (no GitHub Actions run observed; `gh` unauthenticated) and nothing here is CI VERIFIED.
