# Portfolio — Authoritative Project Status

**Date:** 2026-11-14  
**Repository:** ASAA1229/Portfolio  
**Working branch:** new  
**Release:** NO-GO

This is the single authoritative current status source. Historical requirements, story, POC and roadmap records remain in REQUIREMENTS.md and do not override this document. Every figure below was produced by a command run locally on branch `new` (Windows 11, Node 24.16, npm 11.13); no GitHub Actions or Jenkins run of these commits has been observed, so nothing here is "CI VERIFIED".

## Product

ABHISHEK: THE SERIES is a four-profile personal portfolio platform with public experiences, private owner-operated Admin/CMS, resume/image lifecycle management, profile-scoped content and optional server-side AI.

| Profile | Route |
|---|---|
| Abhishek | / |
| Amulya / Ammu | /people/ammu |
| Anjini / Bava | /people/bava |
| Sai / Darling | /people/sai |

This is not an approved multi-tenant client SaaS product.

## Engineering maturity

**Re-scored 6.1/10** (arithmetic mean 6.14) from the 4.7/10 baseline. The score measures engineering and operational maturity, not visual quality, and is capped by the absence of any hosted environment evidence.

| Dimension | Baseline | Now | Evidence-based rationale |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Architecture and maintainability | 6.5 | 7.0 | Storage contracts unified (ObjectBucket/StoredObject), lease and optimistic-concurrency modules, pluggable login limiter. src/server.ts is still ~3,000 lines. |
| Requirements and documentation | 4.5 | 7.0 | Status, stories, testing, security, operations, asset and roadmap documents reconciled to command output; REQUIREMENTS.md is still a long historical record. |
| Implementation completeness | 7.0 | 7.5 | Strengths/leadership/training now CMS-managed; published-only sitemap; root-project 404s; chat throttle; skip link. Owner sign-off and hosted behaviour still missing. |
| Testing and QA | 4.0 | 7.5 | 42 Vitest files / 472 tests (1 skipped) plus 4 Node tests; failure-injection, concurrency, security-matrix, contract, SEO, axe and Miniflare R2 suites; 17 Playwright browser E2E (Admin journeys plus keyboard/zoom/reflow/target-size); real-browser audit with INP. The Vitest suite is FLAKY: 2 of 4 reruns on 2026-11-14 had timeouts in the image/resume lifecycle tests (fix in progress, not yet verified), so the 472 figure is not a stable pass. |
| Security and privacy | 5.5 | 7.0 | Shared limiter (KV/R2 CAS), central CSRF guard, 150+ route/session/CSRF assertions, abort propagation. Production-like verification and secret rotation drill absent. |
| Performance and scalability | 4.0 | 6.5 | Budgets measured (below); fonts self-hosted so CLS fell from 0.128 to 0.005; 10.9 MB of unreferenced originals moved out of public/; INP measured, worst 216 ms against a 200 ms target; no field Web Vitals; no hosted load test. |
| Accessibility and compatibility | 4.5 | 6.5 | Zero axe violations in jsdom (49 routes/screens) and in real Chrome with contrast (34 page loads at 2 viewports); skip link and reflow fixed. No screen-reader or device review. |
| CI/CD and DevOps | 5.0 | 6.0 | Stage order, npm audit gate, budget step, package-manager guard, advisory browser job; local manifest verification passes (208 files, coordinator rerun; was 198 before the e2e/ files were added); `e2e` job configured in artifact-integrity.yml. No observed GitHub/Jenkins run. |
| Deployment and infrastructure | 3.5 | 3.5 | Unchanged: no staging deployment, no wrangler deploy, no hosted R2. |
| Monitoring, backup and disaster recovery | 4.0 | 5.0 | Backup/restore round trip and rollback verified against an R2 model; no hosted restore drill, monitoring or alerting. |
| Release readiness and support | 3.0 | 4.0 | Gates run locally and are scripted (`npm run verify`); P0 external validations and owner approval remain. |

## Quality gate results (local, branch new)

| Stage | Initial baseline | Final |
|---|---|---|
| Install | `npm ci` pass | `npm ci` / `npm i` pass |
| Typecheck (`npm run typecheck`) | 15 diagnostics in 5 files | 0 diagnostics, no suppressions |
| Lint (`npm run lint`) | 637 problems (631 errors, 6 warnings) | 0 problems |
| Vitest (`vitest run`) | 34 files; 40 failed / 185 passed / 1 skipped | 42 files; 472 passed / 1 skipped / 0 failed |
| Node test runner (`scripts/on-site-change-detection.test.mjs`) | 4 pass | 4 pass |
| Build (`npm run build`) | pass | pass |
| Bundle budget (`npm run check:budget`) | none | pass (4/4 budgets) |
| Package manager guard (`npm run check:pm`) | none | pass |
| Dependency audit (`npm audit --audit-level=high`) | 2 high + 1 moderate in production dependencies | 0 high; production dependencies 0 vulnerabilities; 10 moderate dev-tooling advisories remain |
| Artifact manifest verification (scripts/artifact-integrity.mjs, customer-release-verifier.mjs) | not run | pass: 208 files (was 198; coordinator rerun, not re-run by the documentation owner), stages 1-3 of the customer verifier (run with simulated GitHub provenance variables) |
| Playwright browser E2E (`npm run test:e2e`) | none | 17/17 passed (Admin login, throttle, CSRF, edit/publish/public view, image upload, backup, logout-everywhere; 8 accessibility checks for keyboard, zoom, reflow and target size) |
| Real R2 emulator suite (Miniflare, run by Vitest) | none | 11 passed (local emulator; not hosted R2) |
| Real-browser audit (`scripts/browser-audit.mjs`) | none | 34 page loads, 0 axe violations (contrast included); 1 budget finding |

## Measured performance (production build, local, no network throttling)

| Metric | Value | Budget |
|---|---:|---:|
| Client JS, gzip total (26 chunks) | 314.6 KB | 450 KB |
| Largest client JS chunk, gzip | 120.4 KB | 180 KB |
| Client CSS, gzip | 25.6 KB | 40 KB |
| Server bundle, gzip (cloudflare preset) | about 603 KB | 900 KB |
| Worst page JS, decoded | 777 KB | 1,200 KB |
| Worst LCP (34 loads, headless Chrome) | 1,064 to 1,504 ms across three runs (mobile median roughly 160 to 420 ms) | 4,000 ms |
| Worst CLS | 0.005 (was 0.128 on mobile home before fonts were self-hosted) | 0.1 |
| Worst INP (web-vitals, scripted interactions) | 216 ms on the last full run (mobile /people/sai/skills, keyboard, 190 ms presentation delay); earlier runs reached 344 ms on /contact | 200 ms — not met on every run |
| Largest per-page image payload | 470 KB | n/a |
| Static media in public/ and src/assets | public/ 1.6 MB after archiving 8 unreferenced originals (10.9 MB) to assets-archive/; src/assets about 1.1 MB | n/a |

CLS finding (resolved): the mobile home hero used to shift after the web font swap (CLS 0.128 against a 0.1 budget) while fonts came from Google Fonts. Fonts are now self-hosted with size-adjusted fallbacks and the worst CLS across all measured loads is 0.005. INP finding (open): INP is now measured in the browser audit with web-vitals and scripted interactions; it is still OVER the 200 ms target (216 ms on the last full run, 344 ms on an earlier run), so the performance budget is not met on every run. These are lab regression guards, not field data.

## Gap register

Statuses use the classification required for this initiative. "Locally tested" means automated tests or scripts run on this machine against in-memory/local models; it never implies a hosted environment.

| ID | Priority | Final classification | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PORT-GAP-001 | P0 | PARTIALLY COMPLETE (downgraded 2026-11-14 from COMPLETE AND VERIFIED because the Vitest suite is flaky) | 0 typecheck errors, 0 lint problems, build and manifest pass; Vitest 472 passed / 1 skipped (flaky: timeouts in 2 of 4 reruns, being fixed) plus 4 Node tests. Commit 2758508 (original); evidence refreshed 2026-11-14. A GitHub run of the pushed SHA has not been observed. |
| PORT-GAP-002 | P0 | PARTIALLY COMPLETE | Contracts unified; cross-isolate lease via conditional writes; failure injection at every storage operation; crashed-isolate recovery; multi-isolate concurrency (src/test/storage-r2-contract.test.ts). Verified against an in-memory model of the documented R2 API and, since commit be1f605, against Miniflare's R2 emulator (11 tests covering storage, limiter and Admin flows); hosted R2 semantics remain unverified (external). |
| PORT-GAP-003 | P0 | PARTIALLY COMPLETE | LoginLimiter interface with memory, R2 compare-and-set and KV implementations (src/lib/login-limiter.ts); central CSRF guard; 104-case admin security matrix; session expiry/revocation/rotation/malformed-epoch tests. R2/KV limiters verified against models only; production-like multi-instance acceptance external. |
| PORT-GAP-004 | P0 | COMPLETE AND VERIFIED (locally) | PERSON_FIELD_COVERAGE proves every public person field is CMS-managed, image-managed, or curated identity; strengths/leadership/training added; four-profile draft/preview/publish/rollback/unpublish matrix over the Admin API; etag concurrency (409). Owner field sign-off remains PORT-US-048. |
| PORT-GAP-005 | P0 | PARTIALLY COMPLETE | Four-profile resume and image lifecycle suites (private originals, public copies, versions, project placement) pass on the in-memory R2 model (commit 62803ad replaced the local disk bucket in these suites), failure proxies and the Miniflare R2 emulator; fixed temp-file collision and symlinked-ancestor root bug. Real R2 reconciliation external. |
| PORT-GAP-006 | P1 | PARTIALLY COMPLETE | 29 contract tests through Worker plus route: auth headers, URL/key validation, paid-fallback opt-in, status mapping without leaks, four-profile isolation including forged client context and drafts, timeouts, cancellation (a real bug: abort signal was dropped; fixed), chat throttle. Gateway stubbed; real JARVIS external. |
| PORT-GAP-007 | P1 | COMPLETE AND VERIFIED (locally) | Published-only sitemap served by the Worker; root `/projects/:slug` now 404 (previously 200); HTTP statuses observed against the built Node server (200/404/301/200); 18 SEO/HTTP tests. Production origin (VITE_SITE_URL) external. |
| PORT-GAP-008 | P1 | PARTIALLY COMPLETE | axe 49/49 clean in jsdom; real Chrome 0 violations incl. contrast at 375 and 1280 px; skip link, landmarks, names, reflow fixed. Playwright accessibility checks (8, commit d8dd006) cover keyboard, zoom, reflow and target size, and surfaced fixes. Manual screen-reader and physical-device review not done. |
| PORT-GAP-009 | P1 | PARTIALLY COMPLETE | Budgets and measuring scripts exist; all static budgets pass; CLS fixed by self-hosting fonts (worst 0.005); INP now measured with web-vitals (commit 12e0aea) and still over the 200 ms target (216 to 344 ms across runs), so the budget is not met; no field data or load test. |
| PORT-GAP-010 | P1 | IMPLEMENTED — NOT FULLY TESTED | Stage order typecheck, lint, test, build, budget, manifest; npm audit gate; package-manager guard; Jenkinsfile aligned; YAML parses; every command run locally. GitHub Actions and Jenkins runs not observed; Nexus intentionally disabled. |
| PORT-GAP-011 | P1 | BLOCKED BY EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY | Staging deployment requires owner-approved Cloudflare environment; out of bounds (no wrangler deploy). |
| PORT-GAP-012 | P1 | PARTIALLY COMPLETE | Backup/restore round trip byte-for-byte, incomplete/tampered/unsafe backups rejected with zero writes, rollback after injected write failure, migration (src/test/storage-r2-contract.test.ts). Hosted restore drill, RPO/RTO and alerting external. |
| PORT-GAP-013 | P1 | BLOCKED BY EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY | Branch protection and integration plan need owner approval; not touched. |
| PORT-GAP-014 | P1 | COMPLETE AND VERIFIED (cross-document audit) | This file is the single status source; TESTING, SECURITY, OPERATIONS, ARCHITECTURE, RELEASE_READINESS, ROADMAP, USER_STORIES, POC and REQUIREMENTS updated on 2026-11-14 and reconciled to command output. |
| PORT-GAP-015 | P2 | PARTIALLY COMPLETE | ASSET-LICENSES.md restored and reconciled; full inventory with sizes/usage in ASSET_PROVENANCE.md. Per-image rights and subject consent need the owner. |
| PORT-GAP-016 | P2 | COMPLETE AND VERIFIED (locally) | `packageManager: npm@11.13.0`, engines, `check:pm` guard in CI and Jenkins. bun.lock is retained and documented as non-authoritative; recommendation: delete it once the Lovable editor no longer needs it. |

## Security findings (fixed in this initiative)

1. Failed-login throttle was per-process; now pluggable and shared (R2 CAS or KV), fail-closed when the store is unreachable.
2. Client disconnect did not cancel the upstream AI request (abort signal lost in body-limit wrappers); fixed.
3. Local-disk storage was enabled whenever `import.meta.env.DEV` was true (tests, dev builds); now only the Vite dev server.
4. Local-disk bucket accepted a root under a symlinked ancestor and used a non-unique temp name for concurrent writes; fixed.
5. CSRF checks were per-handler; a central Origin and Sec-Fetch-Site guard now covers every admin mutation.
6. Content and persona documents were read-modify-write without concurrency control; now etag-conditional (409 on conflict).
7. Production dependencies had two high advisories (zod, vite); upgraded to zod 4.6.x and vite 8.3.8; 0 production advisories remain.
8. Public chat had no throttle; added per-client limit (KV when bound, otherwise per isolate).
9. Residual: a crashed isolate leaves its storage lease until the 120-second TTL expires, delaying writes; the per-isolate chat throttle is not shared without KV; `/api/admin/*` authentication is unauthenticated-404 by design.

## Branch baseline

| Branch | Finding |
|---|---|
| main | Default branch; older production baseline; never touched |
| dev | Behind new |
| new | Authorized working branch; all work committed and pushed here |
| fix, test | Identical to main at last observation |

Large integration gap to main/dev remains; do not merge blindly (PORT-GAP-013).

## Delivery order

1. GAP-001 through GAP-007: implemented and locally verified (see register).
2. GAP-008/009: automated evidence in place; CLS fixed; INP still above target; manual accessibility review and field measurements remain.
3. GAP-010/012/014/015/016: implemented; hosted runs and owner rights confirmation remain.
4. GAP-011/013: blocked on owner-controlled environments.

## Constraints and release

Preserve React + TypeScript + TanStack Start and Cloudflare/R2. Keep four-profile personal portfolio scope. Work on new only; no force-push, history rewrite, branch deletion or merge. This initiative authorizes local validation and code/docs on new, not production probing, provisioning, deployment, Nexus publication, branch-protection changes or release. Release is **NO-GO** until hosted storage and security acceptance, staging deployment, manual accessibility review, owner four-profile sign-off, rollback rehearsal and explicit owner approval are complete.

## Documentation reconciliation — 2026-11-14 (documentation owner)

Corrected stale statements to match command output and the coordinator's reruns: Vitest 42 files / 472 passed / 1 skipped (flaky, see Testing row); Playwright 17/17; Miniflare R2 11 tests; manifest 208 files; CLS 0.005 after self-hosting fonts; INP measured and still above 200 ms. Documentation-owner reruns on head c91bd10: `npm run typecheck` exit 0 and `npm run lint` exit 0. No GitHub Actions or Jenkins run has been observed (the `gh` CLI is unauthenticated), so nothing is CI VERIFIED.
